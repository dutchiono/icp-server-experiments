# ICP Server Experiments

> **Active Research Project**: Experimenting with Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for decentralized server infrastructure

## Project Purpose

This repository contains experiments and analysis for deploying decentralized backend services using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The goal is to evaluate ICP as a viable alternative to traditional cloud infrastructure, with specific focus on:

- **Canister deployment and management**: Testing different canister types (Rust, Motoko, Azle/TypeScript)
- **Cycle economics**: Understanding compute costs, storage costs, and cycle burn rates
- **Performance benchmarks**: Measuring latency, throughput, and scalability
- **Developer experience**: Evaluating tooling, deployment workflows, and debugging capabilities
- **Cost comparison**: Analyzing total cost of ownership vs. AWS, GCP, and decentralized alternatives

## Comparative Analysis

This project also compares ICP with other decentralized infrastructure solutions, particularly:

- **Net Protocol**: EVM-based storage layer for on-chain data persistence
- **IPFS/Filecoin**: Distributed file storage
- **Arweave**: Permanent storage solution

### Key Comparison Points
- Compute vs. storage trade-offs
- Cost predictability and cycle management
- Censorship resistance and decentralization guarantees
- Integration complexity with existing Web2 and Web3 stacks

## Documentation

- **[Comprehensive Study Document](./docs/icp-netprotocol-study.md)** _(coming soon)_ - Detailed research findings, cost breakdowns, and architectural recommendations

## Setup Instructions

_This section will be populated as experiments progress_

### Prerequisites
- DFX SDK installation
- Cycles wallet setup
- Development environment configuration

### Quick Start
```bash
# Installation and deployment commands will be added here
```

## Cost Analysis

_Detailed cost breakdown and ROI calculations will be added based on experimental results_

### Preliminary Findings
- Cycle costs per operation type
- Storage costs (per GB/month equivalent)
- Compute costs (per million instructions)
- Comparison with traditional cloud providers

## Examples

_Code examples and deployment scripts will be added as experiments are conducted_

### Planned Experiments
1. Simple HTTP canister (hello world)
2. REST API backend
3. Database-backed application
4. File storage and retrieval
5. Cross-canister calls and composability
